Possible events for epidemic simulation:

1. Natural Events:
   - Seasonal changes (winter/summer) - affects spread rate
   - Virus mutation - changes in infection parameters
   - New strain emergence - possibility of reinfection
   - Natural disasters - forced population migration

2. Social Events:
   - Mass gatherings - temporary increase in contacts
   - Panic - increased movement speed
   - Migration - movement of groups of people
   - Quarantine in specific zones
   - Closure/opening of schools and businesses

3. Medical Events:
   - Vaccine development - possibility of immunization
   - Treatment improvement - increased recovery chance
   - Hospital overload - increased mortality
   - New diagnostic methods
   - Mass testing

4. Behavioral Events:
   - Mask mandate implementation
   - Social distancing
   - Remote work
   - Changes in hygiene habits

5. Economic Events:
   - Medicine shortage
   - District border closures
   - Transportation restrictions
   - Goods shortage (panic behavior)

6. Random Events:
   - Super spreaders
   - Local outbreaks
   - False negative tests
   - Asymptomatic carriers
