Epidemic Simulation Logic:

1. Population:
   - Each person has coordinates on the map
   - People move randomly within world boundaries
   - Each person has a state: healthy, infected, recovered
   - Possible additional parameters:
     * Age (affects recovery probability)
     * Immunity (resistance to infection)
     * Social activity (number of contacts)
     * Precautionary measures compliance

2. Disease:
   - Main parameters:
     * Base infection probability on contact
     * Infection radius
     * Incubation period
     * Disease duration
     * Recovery probability
     * Mortality rate
   
   - Infection mechanics:
     * Contact proximity check (distance between people)
     * Infection probability calculation considering factors
     * Consideration of immunity and other individual parameters
   
   - Disease stages:
     * Incubation period (infectious but no symptoms)
     * Active phase (symptoms, high infectivity)
     * Recovery (gradual decrease in infectivity)
     * Immunity (temporary or permanent protection)

3. Spread mechanics:
   - Direct contact between people
   - Contact duration consideration
   - Distance impact on infection probability
   - Possibility of asymptomatic spread
   
4. Influencing factors:
   - Population density in different areas
   - Social measures (quarantine, masks)
   - Medical measures (vaccination, treatment)
   - Seasonal changes
   - Virus mutations

5. Statistics and analysis:
   - Case count tracking
   - R0 calculation (basic reproduction number)
   - Epidemic development forecasting
   - Measure effectiveness analysis
   - Graph plotting and visualization
